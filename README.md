# Deep Learning Intensive
> Practical skills in Python for deep learning

## Overview

Deep learning frameworks greatly simplify the use of models. We cover the essential theory, skills, and technical detail to all users to take advantage of these frameworks. This workshop centers on transformer models and their application to natural language processing, image processing, and sound processing. 

## Workshop Schedule
**Day 1**  
Introductions

Introduction to deep learning

Deeper dive into transformers  

Feature extraction vs Fine-tuning  

Breakout: When do you need fine-tuning?  

**Day 2**  
Hands-on: NLP tasks with pipelines  

Understanding the APIs for inference tasks  

Using data for inference on Google Colab through Google Drive
