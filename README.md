# Deep Learning Intensive
> Practical skills in Python for deep learning

## Overview
The objective of these workshops is to develop foundational skills in basic Python and pandas to faciliate work with deep learning frameworks - primarily HuggingFace.  This workshop will cover Python basics - including basic data types and data structures, conditional execution, looping, and functions.  We'll then move into using pandas, the premier package for data analysis in Python to faciliate simpler manipulation of data for usage with transformers.  Lastly, we'll focus on applying these foundational skills to understanding APIs by examining the broader topic of object-oriented programming.  This will not be an exhaustive overview of Python, but is intended to introduce concepts relevant for using and understanding deep learning APIs and tutorials.

Open-source packages stand on the shoulders of giants.  The content for these workshops was developed in conjunction with a number of resources specifically from Jake VanderPlas and the Software Carpentries.  These resources are provided below, and provide expansive information on Python and data science packages.  The Software Carpentry resource in particular provides instruction, examples, exercises, and solutions; make sure to review this resource to learn more about common analysis tasks using Python
