# Deep Learning Intensive
> Practical skills in Python for deep learning

## Overview

Deep learning frameworks greatly simplify the use of models. We cover the essential theory, skills, and technical detail to all users to take advantage of these frameworks. This workshop centers on transformer models and their application to natural language processing, image processing, and sound processing. 

## Workshop Schedule
**Day 1**  
Introductions  
Introduction to deep learning  
Introduction to Transformer models  
Introduction to transformer processing lifecycle  
Introduction to huggingface.co  
Introduction to pipelines  
Breakout: Applications of pipelines  
Deeper dive into transformers  
Feature extraction vs Fine-tuning  
Breakout: When do you need fine-tuning?  

**Day 2**  
Hands-on: NLP tasks with pipelines  
Understanding the APIs for inference tasks  
Using data for inference on Google Colab through Google Drive  
**Homework:** Ensure access to your data through Google Drive

**Day 3**  
Introduction to fine tuning models  
Practical deep learning:  
-Imbalanced data
